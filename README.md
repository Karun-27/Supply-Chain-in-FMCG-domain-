# Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart, a rapidly expanding FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, currently operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. With plans to expand into metro and Tier 1 cities over the next two years, the company is facing a critical challenge—several key customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to service issues.

It is suspected that repeated instances of late or incomplete deliveries have led to poor customer satisfaction. To address this problem before scaling operations, management has tasked the supply chain analytics team with tracking daily service levels for all customers, specifically focusing on:

On-Time Delivery (OT%)
In-Full Delivery (IF%)
On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)
The goal is to monitor these metrics against target service levels, allowing swift corrective actions when issues arise.

# Task
Peter Pandey, a newly joined data analyst in the supply chain team, has been assigned to develop a performance dashboard that provides real-time visibility into delivery service levels. As Peter, your tasks include:

Developing key metrics based on the predefined metrics list.
Designing a dashboard aligned with stakeholder requirements (as discussed in a business review meeting, presented in comic form).
Extracting additional insights beyond those explicitly mentioned in the meeting or metric list.

Peter’s personal notes from the stakeholder meeting
Your objective is to create a data-driven solution that helps AtliQ Mart identify and resolve supply chain inefficiencies, ensuring improved service levels before expansion.
